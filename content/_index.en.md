## About me

I work as engineer designing IT systems for an IT service provider in the
infrastructure as a service area and for cloud services.

When I am not at work, I take part in civil protection services of the
german Red Cross and help people as a voluntary paramedic.

Additionally I help a non-profit organisation as stage technician with
their yearly musical productions.

When I have additional time to spare, I love to travel the world to see the
most stunning and beautiful landscapes.
